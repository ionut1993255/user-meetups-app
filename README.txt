Welcome to my "User Meetups" application !!!

The purpose of this application is to store my favorite meetups from my day-to-day life.

You can add a new meetup by navigating the page "Add New Meetup". There you can find a 
well designed form where you can enter a title, an URL of an image, an address and a description
of the event.

These events will ultimately be displayed in the "All Meetups" part of the website which is accesible 
from the menu.

The user can save the favorite meetups on the "All Meetups" page and then he can go on "My Favorites" 
page to view the favored elements.

I used HTML5, CSS3, JS ES6, React and React Router DOM to implement the logic of the pages.

Check out the custom favicon *wink *wink

Hope you enjoy !!!
